# Kiet Reduced Keyboard II (KRKII)
A Bakeneko style oring mount 60% keyboard with AEK-inspired side profile curve. Can be used for Alps or MX build

## What the KRKII has
- Curved side profile similar to the Apple Extended Keyboard series
- Unikorn/ Bakeneko V1/ Cannonkeys Bakeneko mounting points for more PCB compatibility
- Added 2mm space under the PCB for improved Alps acoustic
- Symmetrical HHKB blockers compatible with Tsangan 7u bottom row and AEK bottom row

## How to order
**Important**: This case has approximately 3mm thickness blockers, this might be an issue for CNC machining or increase cost. I would highly recommend 3d printing instead for cost reduction (Prototype pic is 3d printed SLA resin)

### Case
Use the provided ``KRKII_Production`` STEP or STL file to get CNC machining quotes or 3d printing quotes.

### PCB
I have personally tested the **Waffling60 Alps** version with USB port desolder, but technically all Unikorn compatible PCBs should work.

### Plate
Depending on your layout needs and if you're running MX or Alps build

For AEK layout:

https://4pplet.com/products/iso-aek-60-plate?variant=40534518923450

https://rndkbd.com/collections/alps-parts/products/60-alps-aek-fr4-plate

Alternatively, you can create a layout on http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and use Ai03 Plate gen https://kbplate.ai03.com/ to create a DXF file and get the plate custom cut

### Other
This uses Unified C3 Daughterboard and regular 60% sized Oring, just like other bakeneko-like keyboards
